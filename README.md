# vk-stuff
Scripts and functions, which is using vk api.

There is no tools/config.py and tools/people.py, you need to create them.

Write this into tools/config.py:

```python
app_id = 123456789
login = 'your login'
password = 'your password'
```

there app_id is id of your app (you can create it [here](https://vk.com/apps?act=manage))

tools/people.py is a file where you can store ids, e.g.

```python
durov = 1
my_group = 123456789
```
